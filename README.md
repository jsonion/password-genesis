# password-genesis

This is a module for generation of secure and deterministic passwords from a selection of significant, immutable inputs. Main such inputs considered are hash signatures of genesis blocks found on major public blockchains.

Being pushed aside, one must strengthen their will and outrun verdicts that drive towards the bleeding edge. Ghosting and gaslighting may stun and hamper the ability to react and comprehend events in a rational way.

This project builds upon a fringe possibility of exististence in simultaneous, closely resembling realities. The intended solution is seeking to introduce a simple, deterministic process that helps generate a memorable login password â€“ a safeword to recover from the thought of falling through the eternal void.

Package consists of the following elements ...
- list of genesis block hashes
- a shortlist of block explorers' APIs to verify block hashes
- user interface helper methods

User interface methods are designed to support forming a password that's memorable and unique across multiple universes. Therefore, cross-chain patterns, character collocation and character indexes are suggested on each step.

This way you can always know when a centralized entity is playing with your mind.
